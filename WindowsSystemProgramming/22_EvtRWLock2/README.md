In the `_tmain()` function, th`_hevRO`e `ERWLOCK` struct is initialized, which contains three Win32 synchronization primitives: two auto-reset events (`_hevRO` and `_hevWO`) and a mutex (`_hmuWO`). `_hevRO` is signaled when there are no writers waiting to write, while `_hevWO` is signaled when there are no readers waiting to read. `_hmuWO` is used to ensure mutual exclusion among writers.

Two arrays of thread handles are created, one for writers (`woThrs`) and one for readers (`roThrs`). A loop creates `MAX_WRITE_CNT` writer threads and `MAX_READ_CNT` reader threads. Each thread is passed a pointer to the `ERWLOCK` struct.

After creating all the threads, the program waits for user input (using `getchar()`) to exit. Once the user enters a character, `g_bIsExit` is set to `TRUE`, which signals all threads to exit. The program then waits for all reader threads to finish (using `WaitForMultipleObjects()`) before waiting for all writer threads to finish.

The `ReaderProc()` function implements the reader thread. It first waits for `_hevRO` to be signaled, then acquires `_hmuRO` to enter the critical section. After reading from the shared resource, it releases `_hmuRO` and signals `_hevRO`.

The `WriterProc()` function implements the writer thread. It first waits for `_hevWO` to be signaled, then acquires `_hmuWO` to enter the critical section. After writing to the shared resource, it releases `_hmuWO` and signals `_hevWO`.
