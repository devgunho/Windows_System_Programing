// Defines the frequently used standard system include files and project-related include files including stdafx.h.
// Including stdafx.h improves build performance and is also used to include content that is not frequently changed during the build process.
// stdafx.h is primarily used to declare commonly used header files and to shorten build time by not preprocessing less frequently used header files.
// This file defines both the standard system include files and the infrequently changed include files.
